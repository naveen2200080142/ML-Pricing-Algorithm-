Instructions to run:
-------------------------------------------
There is 4 Jupiter notebook in this folder
 ----> "Complete_ML_Pricing_Algorithm.ipynb"
----->"ML_Pricing_Algorithm_Part1.ipynb"
----->"ML_Pricing_Algorithm_Part2.ipynb"
----->"ML_Pricing_Algorithm_Part3.ipynb"

>>>>>>>>>          you can open     Complete_ML_Pricing_Algorithm.ipynb         <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

if you want parts wise , you can run them individually
The notebook contains the following keys:

nbformat and nbformat_minor: These indicate the Jupyter Notebook version.
metadata: Metadata about the notebook.
cells: The main content of the notebook (code, markdown, outputs).
I'll now inspect the cells section to determine the structure and provide instructions for running the code. ​​

The notebook begins with markdown descriptions and contains code cells focused on scraping and analyzing restaurant data. Here's a brief overview of the first few cells:

Markdown: Introduces the first task to find the lowest local price and gather data from a specific restaurant using Yelp.
Markdown: Lists the specific details to be retrieved (e.g., name, address, menu items, prices).
Code: Imports required libraries like requests, pandas, BeautifulSoup, and json.
Code: Defines a function to fetch the restaurant's name from a URL.
Code: Retrieves address details using an API key (a placeholder for YOUR_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY is included).
Instructions for Running the Notebook
Set Up the Environment:

Install the required libraries if they are not already available:

>>>pip install requests pandas beautifulsoup4
Ensure you have Python installed with Jupyter Notebook support:

>>>pip install notebook
API Keys:

Replace placeholder API keys (e.g., YOUR_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY) with valid keys from the respective service providers.
Open the Notebook:

Launch the Jupyter Notebook interface:

>>>jupyter notebook
Navigate to the directory containing the .ipynb file and open it.
Execute Cells:

Run the notebook cell by cell to ensure sequential execution:
Click on the first cell and press Shift + Enter to execute.
Verify that each cell runs without errors before proceeding to the next.
Verify Outputs:

Check for successful data retrieval and processing at each step.
If you encounter issues (e.g., failed requests or invalid API responses), debug based on the error messages.
Let me know if you'd like detailed guidance on any specific part of the notebook or its setup.
